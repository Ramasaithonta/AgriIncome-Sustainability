# AgriIncome-Sustainability
# Overview
Climate change is a major threat to the world with serious consequences for agriculture and food security.
Rising global temperatures are causing extreme weather patterns, such as droughts, floods, and unpredictable growing seasons.
These environmental stresses have already resulted in crop failures, impacting the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers.
The effects of climate change on agriculture have a ripple effect on the global food system.
The idea is about to predict these outcomes of the environment and make a idea on the sustainable agriculture.
By choosing sustainable agriculture the investment of the farmer on agriculture products will be reduced.

# Hardware Requiments
1.Ultrasonic sensor
